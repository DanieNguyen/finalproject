# Analyzing Foodborne Diseases over Time 

Looking at the most common foods, locations as well as trends over time with fatalities, averages

### Description

Our team analyzed this dataset from Kaggle regarding foodborne diseases from 1998 - 2015: https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/foodborne-diseases/data to create an interactive Shiny app, accessible here: https://danielnguyen.shinyapps.io/finalproject/. The shiny app looks at trends over time, most common foods and locations, the worst diseases, and the rate of fatalities. 

### Instructions

Our code is split into two files: ui.R and server.R. One for the user interface side of the shiny app and one that does the processing and data retrieving. We had a team of four members and each member had their own section which was commented as '#memberName'. The dataset is in this repository as outbreaks.csv.
